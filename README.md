# ASEI CS - Standalone
Application Server Event Interface :: Client Side

## ASEI Standalone
ASEI CS is the client-side portion of ASEI. Unlike it's server-side counterpart, it
can be used by itself without any other overhead code required. The ASEI CS standalone 
edition only requires a single JavaScript file to add to your website or application.

## Including the script
You will need to include your script in your html or server-side language file on your
webserver. This will be done by adding a &lt;script&gt; tag with its source being the 
location of asei.js.

If you need help with this you can [search for help](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+add+a+javascript+file+to+html&oq=how+to+add+a+javascript+file+to+html "Search for Help") on the internet.
