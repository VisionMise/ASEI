The main purpose \r\nis to wrap up existing functionality, but to combine similar technologies in to a \r\nsingle usable object.\r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\nASEI.js uses jQuery 2.0.3 and the EventSource object to wrap up server-side events\r\nand client-side post requests. Because the EventSource object is optimized for\r\nserver polling and controlled by the server, it deminishes the need for additional\r\ncontorollers to handle push-style notifications from server to client. In the same\r\nregaurd, jQuery's .post() method wraps up client-side requests made to the server.\r\n\r\n## Combined Architecture\r\nBy using these technologies together, you can facilitate both server-to-client and\r\nclient-to-server communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# About ASEI SS\r\nASEI SS stands for Application Server Event Interface - Server Side. The server side\r\nof ASEI is written in PHP and is designed to respond to EventSource connections and\r\nPOST requests from ASEI CS. Though ASEI SS is not requied to utilize ASEI, it does\r\nhave mirroring functionality that allows a more effecient level of creation when\r\ndeveloping communications between server and client.\r\n\r\n## ASEI Class Object\r\nThe ASEI SS Class is a single class and some lightweight functional code that is designed\r\nonly for use with ASEI CS. Whereas you may use ASEI CS without ASEI SS by making your own\r\nserver-side responder, you cannot however, use ASEI SS without ASEI CS. In theory is it\r\npossible, it would be a pointless undertaking.\r\n\r\n## ASEI Framework\r\nWith plans to someday extend the functionality in to more than a single server and single\r\nclient file; we wish to expand in to a full blown framework which operates on the basic\r\ntwo-way communication platform we are building with ASEI. With much work left to be done\r\non the ASEI CS/SS, this is still far in the future, but one of our eventual goals.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
